## A terraform module to manage grafana configuration as code
Welcome to our repository dedicated to enhancing your Grafana deployment experience using Terraform! Grafana, a powerful open-source analytics and monitoring platform, has become integral for many organizations seeking insightful visualizations of their data. To streamline and automate the deployment process, we've leveraged Terraform, a robust infrastructure-as-code tool.

In our quest for efficiency, we recognize the significance of the Grafana Terraform Provider. This invaluable tool enables seamless integration of Grafana configurations into your infrastructure code, promoting consistency and repeatability. To further simplify the deployment journey, we've crafted a modular Terraform module based on this provider. This modular approach allows you to reuse code effortlessly, promoting scalability and reducing redundancy in your Grafana deployments.

Explore our module, delve into the codebase, and witness how adopting a modular structure can significantly enhance the manageability and agility of your Grafana deployments. We invite you to join us in making Grafana and Terraform integration a smoother, more enjoyable experience for the entire community!
